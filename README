The Azavea Minifier combines JSLinting, merging multiple files, and minifying via
the YUI compressor all into one simple and configurable build step.

It can merge multiple JavaScript files into one, or multiple CSS files into one,
and it will move all referenced images from the CSS files into appropriate locations
(since CSS image locations are always relative to the CSS file's location).

The minifier is intended to be run as part of a build process, so it checks timestamps
on all input files and will only re-minify the files that have changed.

Run minifier.py with no parameters for a description of the command line options and
the config file format.
